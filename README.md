MetalGear32's Eve Online PI Templates

These Templates require Command Center Upgrades V and are designed to be run every 24 hours.

Extractors should be set to pull no less than 48,000 units per hour during the 24 hour extraction cycle. Factories will convert P0 to P1 on the same planet and are routed to the launch pad.

The P2 factories require 7,680 units of P1 to run for a full 24hr cycle, and will be converted to P3 on the same planet. The input launch pad will be the launchpad on the left hand side of the template, while the output is on the right. Make note of the launch pad names when you place the template, as the order of the launchpads in the Customs Office drop-down may be different from planet to planet.
