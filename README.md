MetalGear32's Eve Online PI Templates

To use these templates you must enable the Plantary Industries Templates preview feature in your Eve Online client. To do this navigate to Settings > Feature Previews > Click Enable. No restart of the client is required.

To import the templates navigate to your Neocom Menu > The Agency > Resource Harvesting > Planets > Planetary Industry. From here you can examne the planets in your system and establish a command center on each planet you'd like to extract from (NOTE: Fully upgrade the Command Center to level 6 at this point). Once your command centers are placed, you can import and deploy the templates by viewing the planet in Planetary Interaction mode and clicking "Open Templates". Copy the code from the desired template onto your clipboard, then click the "Import & Export" button in the upper left hand corner and select "Load From Clipboard". Click OK to continue, then you may either use the sliders in the preview window to move the location of the template, or click and drag one of the objects on the planet and place it in the desired location. Click "Confirm and Install" to build the template. Once completed and the build has been submitted, click "Save as Template" to commit the template to your own client for later use.

These Templates require Command Center Upgrades V and are designed to be run every 24 hours.

Extractors should be set to pull no less than 48,000 units per hour during the 24 hour extraction cycle. Factories will convert P0 to P1 on the same planet and are routed to the launch pad.

The P2 factories require 7,680 units of P1 to run for a full 24hr cycle, and will be converted to P3 on the same planet. The input launch pad will be the launchpad on the left hand side of the template, while the output is on the right. Make note of the launch pad names when you place the template, as the order of the launchpads in the Customs Office drop-down may be different from planet to planet.
